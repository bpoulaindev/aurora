  "Showcase.w3d.description": "For two years at WeLoveDevs, I immersed myself in development by exploring <0>UI/UX</0>. Passionate about carefully designed mockups and features, I gained expertise in <0>React</0> and <0>TypeScript</0> and of course <0>Tailwind CSS</0>. <1 /><1 /> These two years allowed me to deeply discover <0>Figma</0>, but also to try <0>Rive</0> for 2D animation. Firebase and Redux were widely used, and a transition to <0>Next JS</0> and <0>React Query</0> helped optimize the project as a whole. <1 /><1 /> I was able to contribute to the redesign of the homepage and other pages with less current design, thus perfecting my sense of design and technical skills.",
